This is a simple program to make a saved text file of every file on a drive that matches the name filtering using WizTree's command line input. 

If a drive is missing, a timestamped message will be recorded in a file so it is known when it started missing

Python script should be run through Windows Scheduler with elevated rights to make it run on a schedule and to get rid of the WizTree UAC pop up.
